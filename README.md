thesis2-copy_seed
=================

Copies the seed data from one skin to another.  You can then generate a zip file for the new skin and distribute it normally.

How to use.

Edit $original_skin and $new_skin variables to match the class names of the skins you want to copy the data from and to respectively.
Upload copy_skin.php to your root WP folder.
Run the script via your browser.

Keep in mind there's no admin checking etc. so I would highly recommend removing the file from your server once the copy is complete.

Use at your own risk.
